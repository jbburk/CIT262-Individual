# Hello World!

This repository was created to complete coursework required by CIT 262 from BYU-I.
## About Me
My name is Joshua Burk and this is my repository. 
I would describe my programming abilities to be under development. 
I am familiar with C++, HTML and CSS, JavaScript, and Python. 
I've recently started exploring the world of Linux distributions such as Debian, Fedora, and Ubuntu. 
I think that they can be incredibly useful as well as provide some great entertainment. 
I hope to publish more projects in the future, so stay tuned for more!
